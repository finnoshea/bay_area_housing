# Bay Area Housing - What is affordable?

I started this project to answer the question "which houses, if any, can someone afford in the Bay Area?" Obviously, this question has a lot of subjective and objective answers. I believe the best way to be close to objective is to "talk numbers" and to be as transparent as possible about what I am doing and why.

### Background
This project started in response to the [Stanford Affordability Task Force](https://affordability.stanford.edu/), which was created in 2018. In the four years since it’s creation it has yet to define what it means by affordability, or what makes something affordable. From digging through their website and through my emails it seems the process implemented by the task force is to send out surveys and try to improve future survey results. This does not strike me as an actionable performance objective - it is not the right way to approach a challenge like affordability. I believe the correct approach is to set performance goals and develop actions and metrics to track progress towards goals.

Of course to set goals and define actions and metrics I need some idea what it means to be “affordable”. To me affordability is obviously an economic challenge: there is a market and there are options with tradeoffs. For example, some people absolutely must raise emus in their backyard, or have 4 bedrooms and an office, or will not be able to sleep without an upstairs neighbor. While there are many possible tradeoffs I look at only two: single family homes and commute times to work (I use where I work). The reason I focus on single family homes because they are the ‘American Dream’. Home ownership is ingrained in Americans through our parents, politics and popular culture. It is also the primary method for families to [build intergenerational wealth](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TRt8CwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=home+ownership+build+wealth&ots=KyHtC7xiXs&sig=kZbFoz_CUSCmTk54MVPIvoCT8EA#v=onepage&q=home%20ownership%20build%20wealth&f=false). I compare this to commute times because it is the primary method by which families can reach their home ownership goals. If one cannot afford that 4-bedroom house you need near work, maybe they can afford it one town over.

(Affordability is also a social challenge, but that is a fraught topic that I’m even less qualified to discuss.)
